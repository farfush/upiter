# Introduction

Upiter is an online messaging platform written in F# using patterns such as CQRS & EventSourcing. It leverages ideas put forward in https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/FsUno.Prod and https://github.com/thinkbeforecoding/FsUno when it comes to command handling. On one hand it's a playground for ideas and implementations, on the other hand it tries to be a serious attempt and doesn't shy away from overengineering.
